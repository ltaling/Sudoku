# Sudoku Generator

This python program generates sudoku puzzles along with a corresponding solution. It does run fairly slow so I wouldn't recommend having fewer than 25 clues in the puzzle. However, it is guaranteed to have exactly 1 solution so you can be certain there will be no issues with solving it (although the difficulty is completely random).
